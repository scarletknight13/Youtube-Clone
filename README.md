## Project Description
YouTube is a social media site that came out in 2007. It is one of the most popular social media sites out now. It allows creators to post videos for all to see and comment and comment on.
In our project we'll be emulating the sites most functionality.

## User Stories
- The home route will display our nav on the top, it will also have a sidebar with various links, and in our body will have multiple videos on display
- When a user clicks on the video it should take us to a show page where we can see user comments as well as the artist's name and such.
- We will have multiple Schemas consisting of comments, videos. There will be multiple comments that can be displayed on these videos
- Our video schema will consist of an artist name, length of video, etc..
- Our comment schema will consist of a user name, context, perhaps a like
- Once a video is clicked on, the video should take up a good portion of the screen while still leaving other various components in place
- On the video page a user can write down in a text area and submit a comment. The video can also be liked
## MVP GOALS
- As a user we want to be able to see other users' comments
- As a user we want to be able to click on a video (random array) and it will send to that specific page
- As a user we want to be able to comment on a video
- As a user we want to be able to like a video
## Stretch Goals
- Having a search bar that can filter through our array of videos
- Having a login/register page that will allow the user to have a username and such.
- Keep track of users favorite videos
- Display most popular
